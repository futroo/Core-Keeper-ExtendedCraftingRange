## Introduction

This mod enhances the crafting experience by extending the workbench's range by 7 meters. With this modification, players are no longer required to carry crafting materials with them. Instead, as long as the necessary materials are stored in a nearby chest within a 7-meter radius of the workbench (currently around the player, I will fix this in the future), they will be accessible for crafting. This improvement streamlines gameplay, allowing players to utilize resources conveniently stored in nearby containers without the need to keep them in their inventory during crafting sessions.

#### Expands the range of:
- Workbenches of any type, Cooking Pots, Furnaces, Salvage and Repair Stations, Anvils, Alchemist's Tables, Distillery Tables, Painter's Tables, Carpenter's Tables, Railway Forges, Electronics Tables, Automation Tables, Key Casting Tables, Looms
